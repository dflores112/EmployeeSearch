# Employee Search

> React application build to allow users to: display employee data, allow users to search for employee by name, and filter employee by department and age.


### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

```sh
npm install
npm run seed
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Usage

> A user can search all employees by full name or first/last name. If the input name is not found you will recieve a message stating "no employees match your search". A user can sort by different departments along with sorting by age if needed.

### Support

> There are 8 Enzyme tests with the specs folder.

```sh
npm run test
```

### Roadmap

> Looking to add additional tests to the EmployeeList component along with styling using Styled-Components or Tailwind.
